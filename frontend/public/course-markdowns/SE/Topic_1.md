# Topic 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

### Learning Objectives:
* Understand what software engineering is  
* Learn the importance of systematic software development  
* Get introduced to the software development lifecycle (SDLC)  

## Concept Overview:
**Software Engineering** is a structured and disciplined approach to designing, developing, maintaining, and retiring software.  
Unlike ad-hoc programming, software engineering ensures that software is:
* Reliable  
* Efficient  
* Scalable  
* Cost-effective  
* Maintainable  

It applies engineering principles like planning, testing, and modeling to solve real-world software problems.

## Why Software Engineering?
* Reduces software failures and bugs  
* Improves customer satisfaction  
* Manages large and complex systems  
* Increases productivity through reuse and modular design

## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):

**SDLC** describes the process of building software from start to finish:
1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis: Understanding client needs.  
2. System Design: Designing the architecture, database, UI/UX.  
3. Implementation: Writing the actual code.  
4. Testing: Checking if the code works as expected.  
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users.  
6. Maintenance: Updating and fixing issues after deployment.
