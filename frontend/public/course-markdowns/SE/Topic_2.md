# Topic 2: Software Development Models

### Learning Objectives:
* Learn how software development models shape the workflow  
* Understand advantages and limitations of each model  

## Concept Overview:
**Software development models** define how a project is structured, how tasks are divided, and how teams collaborate.

## Popular Models:

**Waterfall Model**  
* Step-by-step linear model  
* No going back to previous stages  
* Suitable for well-defined requirements  

**Iterative Model**  
* Develop a small version of the software and improve over time  
* Feedback-driven  

**Spiral Model**  
* Combines iterative development with risk analysis  
* Ideal for complex and high-risk projects  

**Agile Model**  
* Focus on collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback  
* Uses sprints (1–4 week cycles)  

## Waterfall vs Agile:

**Waterfall**:  
Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment  

**Agile**:  
Plan ↔ Design ↔ Develop ↔ Test ↔ Review (in each sprint)

## Real-World Comparison:
* Waterfall: Government Projects  
* Agile: Startups, Web Apps
