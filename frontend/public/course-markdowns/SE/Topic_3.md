# Topic 3: Software Requirements Engineering

### Learning Objectives:
* Master requirement gathering methods  
* Differentiate functional and non-functional requirements  

## Concept Overview:
**Software requirements** define what the software must do and how well it must do it. Poor requirements can lead to software failure.

## Functional Requirements:
Describe specific features and functions.  
Example:  
> "The system shall allow the user to reset the password via email."

## Non-Functional Requirements:
Describe system qualities (performance, security, usability).  
Example:  
> "The website should load within 2 seconds on 4G."

## Requirement Gathering Techniques:
* Stakeholder Interviews  
* Brainstorming Sessions  
* Prototyping  
* Document Analysis  

## Use Case Diagram Example:
```
[Student] ──> (Login)
           ──> (View Attendance)
           ──> (Download Notes)
```

## Sample User Story (Agile):
> As a student,  
> I want to receive a push notification for exam schedules,  
> So that I never miss important dates.
