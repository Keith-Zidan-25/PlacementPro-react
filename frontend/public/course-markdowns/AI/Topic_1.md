# Topic 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?

### Learning Goals:
* Understand what AI means and its significance.
* Differentiate between the major types of AI.
* Identify common real-world AI applications.


## Concept Overview:
Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn. The goal of AI is to enable machines to perform cognitive functions like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
AI is a core part of modern software and automation, transforming industries from healthcare to finance, transportation to entertainment.

### Types of AI:
* Narrow AI (Weak AI):
    * Designed for a specific task.
    * Example: Siri, ChatGPT, Google Maps.

* General AI (Strong AI):
    * Hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task like a human.
    * Still under development/research.

* Super AI:
    * AI with capabilities surpassing human intelligence.
    * A futuristic concept, often seen in science fiction.
