# Topic 1: Introduction to Operating Systems


### Learning Objectives:
* Understand what an operating system is
* Learn different types of operating systems
* Understand the core responsibilities of an OS


## Concept Overview:
An **Operating System** (OS) is the most important system software that runs on a computer. It acts as an **intermediary between users and computer hardware**, ensuring that all system and user programs function smoothly.
An OS manages **hardware components**, **software resources**, and provides **services** for application programs. It ensures that the system is **efficient**, **secure**, and **user-friendly**.

## Core Functions of an OS:
* **Process Management**: Manages running programs (processes)
* **Memory Management**: Allocates and deallocates memory
* **File System Management**: Manages storage and access to files
* **Device Management**: Coordinates I/O devices like printers, keyboards
* **Security and Protection**: Protects against unauthorized access

### Real-World Analogy:
Imagine a hotel. The OS is like the hotel manager:
1. Assigns rooms (memory) to guests (programs)
2. Coordinates housekeeping (processes)
3. Handles guest requests (I/O operations)
4. Keeps track of available rooms (resources)

### Examples of OS:
* Windows 11 (Desktop OS)
* Ubuntu Linux (Open-source OS)
* Android (Mobile OS)
* iOS (Apple's Mobile OS)

## Activity:
> Think of the last 3 things you did on your computer (e.g., opened Chrome, wrote a document). Now identify what part of the OS helped in each task.
