# Topic 5: Networking Devices & Topologies

### Learning Objectives:
* Understand the function of core network devices  
* Learn how data flows in different topologies  

## Networking Devices:
| Device | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Router | Routes packets between networks |
| Switch | Forwards data only to target device in LAN |
| Hub | Broadcasts data to all devices (legacy) |
| Bridge | Connects two different LANs |
| Access Point | Wireless hub for devices |

## Network Topologies:
| Topology | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| Bus | One main cable, terminators | Easy to install | Collisions, failure at main cable |
| Star | Devices connect to central hub | Reliable | Hub failure breaks network |
| Ring | Data moves in a ring | Predictable | One break can stop flow |
| Mesh | Each node connects to every other | Fault-tolerant | Expensive setup |

## Real-World Comparison:
* Home Wi-Fi uses Star Topology via a router/switch  
* Corporate backup networks may use Mesh Topology for redundancy
