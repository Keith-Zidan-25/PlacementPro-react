# Topic 1: Introduction to Computer Networks

### Learning Objectives:
* Understand what a computer network is  
* Learn the purpose and applications of networks  
* Explore basic network components and terminologies  

## Concept Overview:
A **computer network** is a group of two or more interconnected computing devices that communicate and share resources using communication channels.  
This connection allows **data exchange**, **collaboration**, and **access to shared services** such as file servers, printers, or the internet.

## Why Networks Matter:
* **Resource Sharing**: Hardware (printers), software (apps), and data files  
* **Communication**: Email, VoIP calls, video conferencing (Zoom, Teams)  
* **Data Access**: Cloud-based apps (Google Drive, OneDrive)  
* **Centralized Control**: Administering network-wide updates or security  

## Basic Components:
* **Host/Node**: Any device connected to a network (laptop, printer)  
* **Router**: Forwards data packets between networks using IP addresses  
* **Switch**: Connects multiple devices within a LAN and forwards data to correct destinations  
* **Modem**: Converts digital signals to analog and vice versa (used for internet access)  
* **Access Point**: Provides wireless access to a wired network  

## Types of Networks:
| Type | Scope | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| LAN  | Local Area Network | Office, Home Wi-Fi |
| MAN  | Metropolitan Area Network | College Campus Network |
| WAN  | Wide Area Network | The Internet |

## Real-World Scenario:
At your university, all lab computers access shared printers and files through a **LAN**.  
This LAN connects to the internet via a **router** and **modem**.

## Activity:
> Think about the devices connected to your home Wi-Fi. Identify which are nodes, how they communicate, and what resources they share.
